<h3><b>Study Design</b></h3><br>To understand different device impact performance, we designed a between-subjects study. We considered the time as the proxy variable for performance.To measure the time, we have users conduct <u>(you can add detailed experimental procedure here)</u>. Participants were assigned to one of the 2 conditions: 1) a, and b.<br><br>Before running the experiment, we formulated and preregistered the following hypotheses.<br><br><b>H1</b>: Participants in the a conditions will result in higher mean value of time than the participants in the device: a > b condition.<br><br><br>We will analyze the hypothesis above with the Mann-Whitney U test. The statistical analysis code can be reproduced by the Tea.<h3><b>Participants</b></h3><br>A prospective power analysis was performed for sample size determination based on Cohen's conventional effect size d = 0.8. We achieved at least 0.8 under &#945; = 0.05 within 13 participants per condition.
