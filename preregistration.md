## 2) **Hypothesis** What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study?   
This is my hypothesis. I'm making a lot of hypothesis here to test things out.    
## 3) **Dependent variable** Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured.   
There will be 1 key dependent variables: 1) time. 
 1. Time. Time is used to measure performance. Please add a little description of this variable if necessary. 
   
## 4) **Conditions** How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to?   
This experiment will be a between-subjects design. It comprises of the following factors and levels: 
1. Device (a, b) Please add a little description of this variable if necessary. 
   
## 5) **Analyses** Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.   
H0: The median value of time in a group will be greater than that in b. We will analyze this hypothesis with Mann-Whitney U test. See the reproducible statistical code for analysis.
   
## 6) **Outliers** and Exclusions Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding observations.   
There are many outliers. Here is some. I'm just writing things out. 
## 7) **Sample Size** How many observations will be collected or what will determine sample size?   
A prospective power analysis was performed for sample size determination based on Cohen's conventional effect size d = 0.8. We achieved at least 0.8 under Î± = 0.05 within 13 participants per condition. 
## 8) **Other** Anything else you would like to pre-register?   
This is some extra things.
